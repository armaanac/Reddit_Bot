### My bot supports Joe Biden. ###

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/main_discussion_thread/) is my favorite thread. It is the main discussion thread. 
I like this thread because it is hilarious to see bots commenting and replying to each other with unrelated political comments. 

This is a screenshot of the thread:
